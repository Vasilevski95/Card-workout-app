# Card-workout-app

This code implements a simple card selection game in which the user can stop a timer and select a card randomly from a deck of 52 cards.

The CardSelectionVC class is a subclass of UIViewController and is responsible for managing the user interface for this game. 
The class has an IBOutlet for a UIImageView object named cardImageView that displays the card images. 
The cards variable is an array of 52 UIImage objects that represent a standard deck of playing cards.

The viewDidLoad() method is called when the view controller's view is loaded into memory. 
It calls the startTimer() method which creates a new Timer object and schedules it to call the showRandomImage() method every 0.1 seconds.

The showRandomImage() method updates the cardImageView with a random card image from the cards array using the randomElement() method.

The stopButtonTapped(_:) and restartButtonTapped(_:) methods are IBAction methods that are called when the "Stop" and "Restart" buttons are tapped, respectively. 
The stopButtonTapped(_:) method stops the timer, while the restartButtonTapped(_:) method stops the timer and then starts it again by calling startTimer().

The Deck struct represents the 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards. It has a single static property called allValues which is an array of 52 UIImage objects. 
Each image corresponds to a specific card in the deck, where the image name is the card rank and suit concatenated together (e.g., "2H" for the 2 of hearts).

Overall, this code provides a basic card selection game with the ability to randomly select a card and stop/restart the timer that displays the card.
